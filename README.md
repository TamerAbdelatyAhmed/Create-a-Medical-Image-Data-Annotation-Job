# Create-a-Medical-Image-Data-Annotation-Job
In this project, you'll be designing a data annotation job using Appen's data annotation tools. You can learn more on their platform homepage. The goal of data annotation is to bring you from unstructured, unlabeled data, to a desired, labeled output. This platform will send the data to human annotators that can help transform unlabeled data.
